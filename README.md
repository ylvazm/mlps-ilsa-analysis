## Overview

This repository contains the R code and raw data used for the empirical analyses in my master's thesis **Treating Item Omissions with a Modified Laplace Smoothing Approach: Consequences for Country-Level Conclusions in International Large-Scale Assessments**, using and examplary **TIMSS 2023** dataset.

In the thesis, I investigated to what extent a recently proposed approach for handling item omissions in ILSA affects the conclusions drawn from the assessment, compared to two classical approaches. To this end, I reanalysed a TIMSS 2023 subset encompassing achievement data of 43 countries under three treatments: (1) Treating omissions as not administered; (2) Scoring them as incorrect; and (3) Modified Laplace Smoothing.

## Requirements and Setup

- **R** version 4.4.2 or higher
  - All required packages are listed at the top of each script and can be installed via `install.packages()`.
- To run the analyses, clone or download this repository to your local machine and set your R working directory to the folder containing `YZM-Thesis/` (not inside it).
  - `rsetwd("path/to/your/folder")  # the folder that contains YZM-Thesis/`
  - The scripts are written for local file access and use relative paths, so this setup is required for seamless execution.

## How to Run the Analysis

The analyses are based on **TIMSS 2023** data. The scripts numbered 01 to 03 contain all code related to data wrangling, starting with the raw TIMSS 2023 data files including all achievement items and participants in grades 4 and 8, and ending with the fully ready-to-analyse data files for grade 8 science. 

- The next section will walk you through the steps I took in data wrangling and analysis.
- Because the raw TIMSS 2023 achievement data files are too large to upload them to GitHub, the first three steps are for viewing only. If you wish to reporduce these steps, kindly download the raw achievement files for grades 4 and 8 via the IEA IDB Analyzer (Ver 5.0.50, IEA, 2025).
- To enable skipping the data wrangling, I uploaded the cleaned and ready-to-analyse grade 8 science subsets in the "Data" folder.
- To start analysing, skip from Step 0 straight to Step 4.

The scripts are designed to be executed **in the following order**:

---

### Step 0 — Run `00_Objects.R` 

- **Purpose:** The purpose of this script is to document all functions and objects I created and used frequently throughout the process of analysing the TIMSS data.
- Run `00_Objects.R` to populate the folder `Objects/` for seamless running of the other scripts.

---

### Step 1 — Run `01_Subset_Choice.R`

> Skip this if you wish to skip the data wrangling and start with the analysis right away.

- This script corresponds to chapter 2.2.1 in the thesis.
- **Purpose:** The purpose of this script is to determine the choice of subset of the TIMSS 2023 data to be used in the present study.


---

### Step 2 — Run `02_Scoring_v0.R`, `02_Scoring_v1.R`, `02_Scoring_v2.R`, `02_Scoring_v3.R`

> Skip this if you wish to skip the data wrangling and start with the analysis right away.

- These scripts corresponds to chapters 2.2.2  and 2.3.1 in the thesis.
- **Purpose:** These four scripts score the raw TIMSS 2023 Grade 8 achievement data using the scoring algorithm provided in the TIMSS 2023 International Database User Guide (Fishbein et al., 2025), each implementing a different treatment of omitted items. 
- `02_Scoring_v0.R` creates a response dataset where the original codes for omitted and not-reached items are kept as-is, while valid item responses are scored. 
- `02_Scoring_v1.R` treats omitted items as not administered. 
- `02_Scoring_v2.R` scores omitted items as incorrect. 
- `02_Scoring_v3.R` treats omitted items as not administered but additionally computes the completeness indicator variables needed for Modified Laplace Smoothing. 
- Each script saves its output as a separate .Rdata file (GRADE8DATA_COMPLETE_v0_SCR.Rdata through GRADE8DATA_COMPLETE_v3_SCR.Rdata), which are used in the subsequent analyses.

---

### Step 3 — Run `03_Data_Prep.R`

> Skip this if you wish to skip the data wrangling and start with the analysis right away.

- This script corresponds to chapter 2.2.2 in the thesis.
- **Purpose:** Prepare the three scored datasets for analysis. 
- Essentially, for each version of the dataset, variables irrelevant to further analyses are removed. 
- The output of these scripts are three versions of the dataset fully prepared for the analyses, g8s_v0 through g8s_v3.
- Optional: To examine the preparation of the three dataset versions by making some logical checks, run `03_Data_Prep_Check.R` from the folder `Scripts/Supplemental/`.

---

### Step 4 — Run `04_Descriptives.R`

- This script corresponds to chapter 2.2.2 in the thesis.
- **Purpose:** This script produces the descriptive statistics for the full sample in the analyses.
- The key output of this script is the descriptive table included in Appendix A.1 and the omission statistics graph reported in chapter 2.2.2
- Optional: For additional graphs, run `04_Descriptives_Supplemental.R` from the folder `Scripts/Supplemental/`.

---

### Step 5 — Run `05_Subsets.R`

- This script corresponds to chapter 2.3.2 in the thesis.
- **Purpose:** In this script, the subsample for item parameter estimation is drawn and compared with the full sample to check representativity.
- The output of this script are three versions of the sampled subset fully prepare for the analyses, corresponding to the three versions of the full dataset.

---

### Step 6 — Run `06_Model_Estimation.R` and `06_Model_Documentation`

- These scripts correspond to chapters 2.3.2 to 2.3.4 in the thesis.
- **Purpose:** These scripts contain the code to estimate all three models for the present analysis and extract relevant objects from them. 
- For each model, first randomly drawn subsample is used to estimate item parameters. Then, the resulting parameters are applied to the full sample models to estimate country means and variances.
- The central output of `06_Model_Estimation.R` are model1, model2, and model3, which will be stored for further inspection and extraction of results.
- The central output of `06_Model_Documentation.R` are the item parameter tables, as well as model and item fit statistics reported in Appendix A.3.

---

### Step 7 — Run `07_Results_Means.R`, `07_Results_Variances.R`, `07_Results_Pseudo-Items.R`

- These scripts correspond to chapters 3.1 and 3.2 in the thesis.
- **Purpose:** These scripts produce the results reported in my thesis.
- In `07_Results_Means.R`, all reported results regarding country means and achievement ranks are produced. This includes (1) the extraction of country means and the computation of achievement rankings for all models, (2) the investigation of the agreement between the produced rankings and ranking differences, (3) the central graph depicting both 1 and 2, and (4) the investigation of the relationship between item omissions and rank differences between the models.
- In `07_Results_Means.R`, all reported results regarding country variances and variance ranks are produced. This includes (1) the extraction of country varaincess and the computation of variance rankings for all models, (2) the investigation of the agreement between the produced rankings and ranking differences, (3) the central graph depicting both 1 and 2, and (4) the investigation of the relationship between item omissions and rank differences between the models.
- Run `07_Results_Pseudo-Items.R` to investigate the Pseudo-Items estimated in Modified Laplace Smoothing and obtain the graph from Chapter...
- Optionally, for further explorations of the means and variances, run `07_Results_Supplemental.R` from the folder `Scripts/Supplemental/`.
